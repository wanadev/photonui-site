The file manager provides two ways to open files stored on the user's hard disk:

* by using a "file open" dialog

* by allowing files to be dragged & dropped on your web app


__NOTE:__ You cannot open the "file open" dialog as you want. The `photonui.FileManager.open` method **must** be called in response to a user event (click,...), otherwise the browser will not allow you to open the dialog.
