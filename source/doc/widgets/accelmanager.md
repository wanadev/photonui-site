This component allows you to easily implement keyboard accelerators (aka shortcuts) in your application. It is based on [KeyboardJS][kbjs].

Please read the KeyboardJS documentation for more information about the keyboard combo composition and syntax:

**NOTE:** By default, accelerators are disabled if a field is focused (this behavior can be changed, as shown in the  `Ctrl + R` example above).
